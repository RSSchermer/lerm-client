  <h3>Step 6: Identify relationship between rules</h3>

  <p>
    Determine relatedness of rules.By this stage the rules are defined in a crisp
    language and uniform grammar. The relationships between the domain concepts
    can now be mapped. That relationships caused by shared data elements will be
    detected automatically and will not have to be added here manually.
